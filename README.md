Assessment of NHS GP data

### **Project Brief:**
The NHS incurs significant, potentially avoidable, costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments. The reasons for missed appointments need to be better understood as explained by The British Medical Association (BMA) chair Professor Philip Banfield:

"While it is frustrating when patients do not attend, the reasons why this happens should be investigated rather than simply resorting to punishing them. Financially penalising patients inevitably impact the poorest and most vulnerable in the community."

(GP Practice News 2022)

Therefore, reducing or eliminating missed appointments would be beneficial financially as well as socially. The government needs a data-informed approach to decide how best to handle this problem.

I assessed the issue, utlising two structured thinking approaches; a fishbone diagram and the 5-whys method

This lead to the refining of the business problem and the formulation of these two guiding questions for the project
### **Guiding Questions:**
1. Are ‘DNA’ appointment rates affected by 'appointment mode'. If so, how do they vary across ICB locations?
2. Do longer booking lead times lead to more ‘DNA’ statuses? and does it vary across ICB locations?

### **Insights and Recommendations:**
